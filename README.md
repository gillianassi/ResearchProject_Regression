# Research Project Gameplay Programming
## Regression
### Goal

The purpose of this research is to broaden my knowledge about artificial intelligence (AI), more specifically, **regression**. This will be done by implementing a set of exercises with both self-generated data and existing datasets to get a better grasp of the subject. Both advantages and drawbacks will be discussed for each type of regression analysed during this research.

### Regression
Modern AI's are machine learning solutions created for a **specific task**. This can vary from understanding and analysing trends in market shares to finding the optimal location for a pizza shop. These AI's aren't considered *real intelligence* but use statistics and analytics to handle different problems dependant on their given training.
The way that such AI's learn can be subdivided into three categories:
* *Spurvised Learning*, in which the algorithms are trained for a specific task with pre-existing datasets and human supervision.
* *Unsupervised learning*, where the algorithm looks for previously undetected patterns  in pre-existing datasets with as less human supervision as possible.
* *Reinforcement Learning*, in which the algorithms learn using trial and error by adding positive and negative values to experiences and situations.

AI's that combine different aspects of learning also exist but are out of the scope of this research.

#### Supervised Learning
The most relevant training method for this research is *Supervised Learning*.  It's problems can be subdivided into

#### Linear Regression
##### Simple Linear Regression
##### Gradient Descent

#### Multivariate Linear Regression

#### Logistic Regression
##### Newtonâ€™s Method
##### Regulised Logistic Regression
