# Research Project Gameplay Programming
## Regression
### Goal

The purpose of this research is to broaden my knowledge about artificial intelligence (AI), more specifically, **regression**. This will be done by implementing a set of exercises with both self-generated data and existing datasets to get a better grasp of the subject. Both advantages and drawbacks will be discussed for each type of regression analysed during this research.

### Regression
AI's are seperated into two main cathegories: '*narrow*' or '*weak*' AI, and '*general*' or '*strong*' AI:
* Weak AI are machine learning solutions created for a **specific task**. This can vary from understanding and analysing trends in market shares to finding the optimal location for a pizza shop. these AI's aren't concidered *real intelligence* but  use statistical analysations to handle different problems dependant on their given training.
